# Prefect Balls Set
Given a set of balls, k(each ball has a number), and three limits x,y and z, return the number of perfect balls sets.
A perfect ball set has three balls where the following conditions apply:
• 0 <= i < j < n < arr.length
• ball[i] - balls[j] <= x
• ball[j] - balls[n] <= y
• ball[i] - balls[n] <= z

Example:
Input: k = [3,0,1,1,9,7], x=7,y=2,z=3
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prefect sets: [(3,0,1), (3,0,1), (3,1,1), (0,1,1)].

Constraints:
• 3 <= k.length <= 100
• 0 <= k[i] <= 1000
• 0 <= x,y,z <= 1000

# Jogging track distance
Imagine a circular jogging track with several rest points, labeled from 0 to n-1. The distance between each rest point is known and recorded in an array called distance[], where distance[i] shows the distance between point i and point (i+1) % n. A person wants to find the minimum distance between two chosen rest points, start and destination, on the circular route,while being able to travel in both directions,clockwise and counterclockwise.

Example 1:
0(Start) - 1(Destination) - 2 - 3.
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.


Example 2:
0(Start) - 1 - 2(Destination) - 3.
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.
